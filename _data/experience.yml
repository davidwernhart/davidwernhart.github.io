    With the focus on bringing classic card games like *Schnopsn*, *Mills* and *Ten Down* to mobile devices, DonkeyCat has found wide success in local and international markets.
    
    Starting as a part-time job to complement my studies, I eventually took on more and more complex projects, with games like *Old Maid* and *Mau Mau* being developed almost exclusively by me.
